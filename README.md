## Project Information

### Description
EquaTrix is a cross-platform mathematical application that enables users to manipulate matrices, solve linear equation systems, integrate functions, and analyze mathematical functions. Built with C++ and Qt, it provides a modern graphical interface for complex mathematical computations.

## Project Architecture

The project is organized into two main components:

- A set of C++ classes for mathematical computations (`Matrix`, `System`, `Function`, `Integral`)
- A graphical user interface using the Qt framework to interact with these classes

## Qt Framework in EquaTrix

### Introduction to Qt

Qt is a cross-platform C++ framework that enables the creation of high-performance, modern graphical interfaces. Here are the key concepts used in our application:

1. **Widgets**: User interface elements (buttons, text fields, etc.)
2. **Layouts**: Arrangement of widgets in the interface
3. **Signals and Slots**: Event mechanism to connect the interface to functionalities
4. **Meta-Object Compiler (MOC)**: System that enriches C++ with features like signals/slots

### Class Integration in Qt

#### Matrix Class in Qt Interface

The `Matrix` class is integrated into the Matrix tab of the graphical interface:

- Matrices are visually represented by editable tables (`QTableWidget`)
- Matrix operations (addition, multiplication, etc.) are performed by directly calling `Matrix` class methods
- Integration process:
  1. User enters values in the interface
  2. Values are extracted and converted to `Matrix` objects
  3. Operations are performed on these objects
  4. Results are converted back for display in the interface

#### System Class in Qt Interface

The `System` class is integrated into the System tab of the graphical interface:

- Users can enter an augmented matrix representing a linear equation system
- The application uses `SystemSolver::analyzeSystem` to determine the solution type
- Solutions are displayed according to their type (unique, infinite, none)

## Compilation and Execution

### Prerequisites

- CMake 3.16 or higher
- C++17 compatible compiler
- Qt 5 or Qt 6 with Widgets module

#### Installing Prerequisites

##### On macOS
```bash
# Installation via Homebrew
brew install cmake
brew install qt@6

# Add Qt to PATH (add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile)
echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/qt@6/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

##### On Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
# Install basic tools
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential cmake

# Install Qt6
sudo apt install qt6-base-dev qt6-base-private-dev
sudo apt install qt6-tools-dev qt6-tools-private-dev
sudo apt install qt6-declarative-dev qt6-declarative-private-dev

# Install additional Qt modules
sudo apt install libqt6widgets6 qt6-tools-dev-tools
```

##### On Linux (Fedora)
```bash
# Install basic tools
sudo dnf install gcc-c++ cmake

# Install Qt6
sudo dnf install qt6-qtbase-devel
sudo dnf install qt6-qttools-devel
sudo dnf install qt6-qtdeclarative-devel

# Install additional Qt modules
sudo dnf install qt6-qtwidgets qt6-qttools
```

##### Installation Verification
To verify that Qt is properly installed:
```bash
qmake6 --version
```

#### With CMake (Recommended for Qt)
Execute the build script:
``` 
./build.sh 
```

### Platform Compatibility

The application is compatible with:

- macOS
- Linux

Thanks to the use of Qt and CMake, compilation and execution follow the same process on all platforms, with only slight differences in execution paths.
